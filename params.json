{"name":"ShAPE-DALSP","tagline":"Simulation Algorithm and Parameter Estimation method (ShAPE) for Division-, Age- and Label-Structured Population (DALSP) models","body":"### Features\r\nThe ShAPE-DALSP software package provides numerical methods for the simulation of division-, age- and label-structured Population models. Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of model parameters from CFSE time-series data. Its key features are\r\n* automatic compilation of symbolically defined DALSP models for the assessment of competing model hypotheses;\r\n* efficient numerical integration by exploiting a decomposition of the solutions;\r\n* multi-start local optimization using forward sensitivity equations for gradient evaluation;\r\n* identifiability and uncertainty analysis using profile likelihoods and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods; and\r\n* parallelization using the MATLAB [Parallel Computing Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/) and [Distributed Computing Server](http://www.mathworks.com/products/distriben/).\r\n\r\nFor the parameter estimation we exploit the Parameter EStimation Toolbox (PESTO) developed in the [Institute of Computational Biology](http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb) of the [Helmholtz Zentrum München](http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de).\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nShAPE-DALSP is a software package for MATLAB. To exploit its functionality the [Optimization Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization/) and the [Symbolic Math Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic/) are required. For high-performance computing, the [Parallel Computing Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/) and [Distributed Computing Server](http://www.mathworks.com/products/distriben/) is required.\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\nIf you use this software in a publication, please cite one of the following manuscripts:\r\n* J.
